A todo app is an array of objects. you keep the state of the todo array 
Every object you add comes with 
- property id: unique id to compare every time you add, delete or update each todo task

a todo object is created onSubmit, as the input to enter the task is a form element and data is sent onSubmit 

function createTask(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    const newTask = {
        id: new Date().getTime(),
        task: todo.task,
        completed: false,
    }
}
